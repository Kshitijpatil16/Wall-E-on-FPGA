# MPU 6050 #

It is an IMU ( Inertial measurement unit ) 
- 6 axis motion tracking device 
- Combines 3 axis accelerometer, a 3 axis gyroscope and a digital motion processor ( DMP ) 

## Inertial measurement unit ( IMU ) ##
- Small devices indicating changing orientation 
- Has both, gyroscope ( measures angular rate ) and accelerometer ( measures linear accelertaion )
- Number of sensor inputs in an IMU are reffered to as DOF ( Degree of freedom ) 
  So, a chip with 3 axis gyroscope and 3 axis accelerometer would be a 6 DOF IMU 
  
### *Considering the 3 conditions* ###

- Rotation around the front-to-back axis is called **ROLL**
- Rotation around the side-to-side axis is called **PITCH**
- Rotation around the vertical axis is called **YAW**
