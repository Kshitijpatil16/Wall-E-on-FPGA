We have 2 grounds :
- DGND (Digital Ground)
- AGND (Analog Ground) : for refrence voltage 

## Waveform rough analysis :

- At positive edge -> Read 
- At negative edge -> Change

The value should be approximated to the nearest integer 
- talking about why 4096 : IC has 12 bit resolution so this is the value of 2(12,pow)

## SERIAL COMMUNICATIONS

- Chip select ( active at low )
- vdd powersupply 2.7+ v 
- Start bit -> signal bit -> 3 data bits 

- In output fist null bit then b11 to b0, we have to capture this 
- Then we make the cs value high to stop the readings 
- Hi z means this is nor 1 nor 0, it is high impedence

## Additional features of MCP3204/3208
- If we don't change CS value to high again it will give reverse bits ( bo to b11 )
- This feature is given where circuits need to specifiaclly read in a order so this becomes helpful in such cases as the user can give the value in both orders and the chip selects the order on its own

- We can either use single channel or also one channel to 2 sensors (We will be using single channe for our project ) 
   
   
## To be remembered while coding according to the datasheet 
- Start bit should be 1 and single bit should also be 1 ( for our purpose this is required )
- Clk should be high in ideal condition and then in every falling edge data should be changed.
